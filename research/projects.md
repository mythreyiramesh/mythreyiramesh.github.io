The following list contains brief descriptions of my research experience as well as my academic projects.

## Current Research Work
- **Computational aspects of the spectral methods for estimation of micromechanical fields in polycrystals**: <br> *Advisor: Prof. Anand Krishna Kanjarla, IIT Madras* <br> Spectral Methods have been used to solve for the micromechanical fields in polycrystals. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to compute the convolution integral that arises naturally in the problem. However, to use the FFT, the computational grid must be uniform. Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transforms (NUFFT) can, however, be performed on non-uniform grids. Hence, the objective is to use NUFFT and perform calculations on non-uniform grids to capture large gradients close to interfaces.

## Past Research Experience
- **Theoretical investigation of stability of High-Entropy Oxides to Lithium intercalation**: <br> *Advisor: Prof. Satyesh Kumar Yadav, IIT Madras* <br>Multi-component oxides, or oxides with multiple cations, possess interesting properties because of the interactions between the different cations. However, because of the number of elements, there is a lot of difficulty in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Well-representative models of these oxides can provide useful insights. In this project, the objective was to understand the utility of these oxides as electrode materials better. A rock salt structured high entropy oxide with five cations was modelled using Special Quasirandom Structures. The ground state energy calculations were performed using the Vienna *ab initio* Simulation Package (VASP).

- **Atomistic simulations of grain boundaries in Fluorite structured oxides**: <br> *Advisor: Prof. Jerzy Szpunar, University of Saskatchewan, Canada* <br> Grain Boundaries play an essential role in determining the mechanical properties of a material. In this project, some of the special Coincident Site Lattice (CSL) grain boundaries were modelled for molecular dynamics simulations, and the grain boundary energy was computed for each case. The simulations were performed using LAMMPS.

- **Thermoelastic analysis of fuel pins**: <br> *Advisor: Prof. Sivasambu Mahesh, IIT Madras* <br>
The objective was to model the fluid-structure interaction between the fuel pins and the surrounding coolant. The simulations were carried out in Abaqus using a co-simulation boundary that was set up between Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/CFD.

## Selected Academic Projects

- **Parallelising molecular dynamics simulations using MPI**: <br> *Term Project: High Performance Computing for Engineering Applications. Instructor: Prof. Sarith Sathian, IIT Madras* <br> Having understood the basics of Message Passing Interface, the objective of the term project was to observe the concepts in action while speeding up a molecular dynamics simulation. A Python script for simulating a microcanonical ensemble (NVE) was written, and the mpi4py library was used to speed up the simulation.

- **Cellular Automata (CA) in solidification modelling**: \[[PDF](/files/Projects/MM5520-Presentation.pdf){:target="_blank"}\] <br> *Presentation: Solidification Phenomena. Instructor: Prof. Gandham Phanikumar, IIT Madras* <br>
One of the ways to model solidification is by using cellular automata. The objective of the term project was to evaluate the ability of a cellular automaton model to simulate solidification. A review of the existing models was performed to compare the most successful models in terms of their treatments of temperature evolution, nucleation and growth kinetics.

- **Analysis of the lid-driven cavity problem using OpenFOAM**: \[[PDF](/files/Projects/MM2041-Report.pdf){:target="_blank"}\] <br> *Term Project: Transport Phenomena. Instructor: Prof. Gandham Phanikumar, IIT Madras* <br> The objective of this term project was to learn OpenFOAM and get introduced to Computational Fluid Dynamics. Using the lid-driven cavity problem as the base case, I explored the file structure and working of OpenFOAM and ran simulations.

## Other Case Studies and Presentations

- **Using Defects to Store Energy**: \[[PDF](/files/Projects/MM5040-Presentation.pdf){:target="_blank"}\] <br> *Presentation: Defects in Materials. Instructor: Prof. Anand Krishna Kanjarla, IIT Madras* <br> The objective was to present a summary of a recent publication which involved crystalline defects in materials and also aligned with our individual research interests. The paper chosen for this presentation was "Lu, I., Bernardi, M. Using defects to store energy in materials â€“ a computational study. Sci Rep 7, 3403 (2017) doi:10.1038/s41598-017-01434-8" \[[Link to Original Paper](https://rdcu.be/bV6f9){:target="_blank"}\].

- **The Monte Carlo Potts Algorithm**: \[[PDF](/files/Projects/ID6105-Presentation.pdf){:target="_blank"}\] <br> *Presentation: Computational Tools - Data Structures, Algorithms and Programs. Instructor: Prof. B. S. V. Prasad Patnaik, IIT Madras* <br> The objective of the presentation was to convey the key principles behind an important algorithm in our individual field of interest to an interdisciplinary audience (comprised of students from departments like Mechanical Engineering, Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Bioengineering, Engineering Design to name a few).

- **Symmetry Breaking Transitions**: \[[PDF](/files/Projects/MM5290-Write-Up.pdf){:target="_blank"}\] <br> *Term Paper: Stability of Microstructures: Instructor: Prof. Gandham Phanikumar, IIT Madras* <br> The objective of the write-up was to pick a stability problem and explain the different effects that are at play. In this write-up, a brief overview of symmetry breaking transitions in equilibrium shapes of coherent precipitates was presented.
