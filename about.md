<p>I am currently a final year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a>, pursuing an interdisciplinary dual degree in <i>Computational Engineering</i> (B. Tech in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering & M. Tech in Computational Engineering).</p>

<p> I get thrilled when unearthing patterns and connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. I recently found a quote that summarises my viewpoint towards learning.
<blockquote cite="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=47314">
<b>
In an age where it is virtually impossible to stay abreast of technology, it is stimulating to find an analysis concept that enables one to approach an unfamilar field with familiar tools.
</b>
</blockquote>
The quote is from E. O. Brigham's <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=47314" target="_blank"> book</a> on Fast Fourier Transforms. I strongly believe the message can be extrapolated. In my opinion, everything that one needs to know is out there waiting to be find out. So, one must just start that journey and never stop learning, and thatâ€™s exactly what I am working on.</p>
