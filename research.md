# Experience

The following list contains brief descriptions of my research experience.

### Current Research Work
- **Computational aspects of the dual grid VP-FFT formulation**: <br> *Advisor: Prof. Anand Krishna Kanjarla, IIT Madras* <br> The micromechanical fields in polycrytals can be estimated using spectral methods that utilise the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, the computational grid must be uniform to perform FFTs. The dual-grid VP-FFT algorithm tries to circumvent this requirement by decoupling computations and material evolution.

### Past Research Experience
- **Theoretical investigation of stability of High-Entropy Oxides to Lithium intercalation**: <br> *Advisor: Prof. Satyesh Kumar Yadav, IIT Madras* <br>Multi-component oxides, or oxides with multiple cations, possess interesting properties because of the interactions between the different cations. However, because of the number of elements, there is a lot of difficulty in understanding the underlying mechanisms. In this project, the objective was to better understand the utility of these oxides as electrode materials. 

- **Atomistic simulations of grain boundaries in Fluorite structured oxides**: <br> *Advisor: Prof. Jerzy Szpunar, University of Saskatchewan, Canada* <br> Grain Boundaries play an essential role in determining the mechanical properties of a material. In this project, the objective was to model some of the special Coincident Site Lattice (CSL) grain boundaries using classical molecular dynamics simulations and compute the grain boundary energy.
