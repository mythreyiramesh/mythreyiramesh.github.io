## Research Interests
I am interested in the intersection of Materials Science, Mathematics and Computing and I hope to expand this intersection through my research.

Here's a list of "keywords" that describe my primary research interests:
* Multi-Scale Modelling of Materials
* Crystalline Defects in Materials
* Mathematical Aspects of Materials Science

Here's a list of "keywords" that paint a broader picture of my research interests:
* High Performance Computing
* Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing
* Computational Engineering and Applied Mathematics

More information about my current and past projects can be found in the [projects](/research/projects/) page. I am looking for PhD positions in the area of <b>Computational Materials Engineering</b> starting in Fall 2020.
