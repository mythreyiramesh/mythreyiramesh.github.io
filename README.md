My Personal Website at mythreyiramesh.github.io
=====================================

This is the repository that holds a repository of my current pursuits as an undergraduate student, things I find interesting and my ventures into writing.

## Theme
The theme was adapted from [Steven V. Miller's](http://svmiller.com) [no-good-very-bad jekyll theme](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template).
