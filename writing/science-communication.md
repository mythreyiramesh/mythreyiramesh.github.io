## What is this?
Science has traditionally been portrayed as a demanding and complex discipline, and it is. To those who stick to science, communicating science is easier with mathematics and conventions in the relevant field. This level of communication is necessary to push science forward, but only such communication isn't enough. In this age where there is an information overload, a better-informed public will make better decisions.

### Not convinced?
In the book A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking says, *"Someone told me that each equation I included in the book would halve the sales."*  It would have surely been easy for Prof. Hawking to simply use mathematics as his language. But he didn't do that because he believed that what he wanted to say was too important to be kept within circles inaccessible to the curious general audience.

On a different note, Albert Einstein is attributed with the quote, *"If you can't explain it simply, you donâ€™t understand it well enough."* Richard Feynman lived by this principle and the famous *Feynman Technique* grew out of it.

So, science writing could be a win-win for both the reader and the writer.

## My activities

### **Immerse - The Annual IIT Madras Science Magazine**
I have been associated with the IIT Madras Magazine on Research in Science and Engineering (IMMERSE) from 2016 to 2019. The aim of Immerse is to tell stories about the research at IIT Madras and to highlight the the excitement of discovery and innovation. Immerse writers talk to professors and their graduate students, read up on the research and write articles about the work.

I was a writer for three annual editions and also served on the Editorial Board for the 2017-18 Edition. Listed below are the article I wrote for Immerse:
* **Combating Cancer - Scaling Heights by Scaling Down**, Immerse 2016-17 Edition. \[[PDF](/files/Immerse/Immerse_2017_Article.pdf){:target="_blank"}\].
* **Thermodynamic Charting of Materials Space**, Immerse 2017-18 Edition. \[[PDF](/files/Immerse/Immerse_2018_Article.pdf){:target="_blank"}\] \[[Complete Edition](/files/Immerse/Immerse_2018.pdf){:target="_blank"}\]
* **Corrosion - A Multi-scale Perspective**, Immerse 2018-19 Edition. \[[PDF](/files/Immerse/Immerse_2019_Article.pdf){:target="_blank"}\]

### **Kenyon Review Young Science Writers Workshop**

<p>I got an opportunity to visit <a href="https://www.kenyon.edu">Kenyon College</a> (Ohio, USA) as a fellow for the <a href="https://kenyonreview.org/workshops/young-science-writers/">Kenyon Review Young Science Writers</a> program in Summer 2019 thanks to <a href="https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/campus-directory/biography/chris-gillen/">Prof. Chris Gillen</a>, who visited IIT Madras for a workshop in December 2018. Kenyon Review is one of USA's preeminent literary magazines, and their writing workshops are established and well-known. My primary job was to be a teaching assistant to the workshop instructors. The participants were high school students from different parts of the US, and I was the only person from outside the US among the instructors. It was a unique experience that I thoroughly relished.</p>

<p> I taught one of the workshop's "genre" sessions entirely, and since I was encouraged to talk about anything I was interested in, I spoke about crystallography, and we built some models of cubic Bravais lattices using modelling clay and bamboo sticks! The participants were thrilled to discover that symmetry played such a crucial role in crystalline materials all around us. The central theme of the workshop, however, was science communication. We talked about different kinds of writing (including poetry!), and the focus was on identifying and incorporating key ingredients that are needed for good science writing. The target audience for all the writing we did was the curious person in the general public who wants to know more about science but doesn't yet have the technical knowledge to understand the relevant jargon.</p>

### **What next?**
I am actively looking for avenues to contribute to science communication and have some ideas that I'd like to see in action soon. If you share this interest and have suggestions, I would love to hear from you.
