# Useful Tools

I have listed below some tools and utilities that I have found to be indispensable at times.

### Writing Mathematics
* [Mathpix Snip Tool](https://mathpix.com){:target="_blank"}: For extracting LaTeX from images and webpages; requires internet for functioning.
* [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html){:target="_blank"}: For quickly getting the LaTeX command for symbols.
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com){:target="_blank"}: For collaborating on LaTeX files.
* [TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com){:target="_blank"}, of course.
* [MathCha](https://www.mathcha.io){:target="_blank"}: This is a WYSIWYG editor for equations, diagrams and more.

### macOS Utilities
* [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com){:target="_blank"}: For easy "window" management on macOS; free altenative to [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com){:target="_blank"}.
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com){:target="_blank"}: Combined with Spotlight, this saves a lot of time.
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh){:target="_blank"}, naturally.

### Miscellaneous
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/){:target="_blank"}: I use [Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs){:target="_blank"} because I prefer to use Vim keybindings.
* [Typora](https://www.alfredapp.com){:target="_blank"}: A resourceful markdown editor.
* [Trello](https://trello.com){:target="_blank"}: A tool to stay organised.
* [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com){:target="_blank"}: A great tool to approach note-taking with graphs and relationships in mind.
* [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com){:target="_blank"}: An interesting JavaScript based tool for building personal wikis. Plenty of plug-ins are available!
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org){:target="_blank"} and [ZoteroBib](https://zbib.org){:target="_blank"}: A tool for organising scientific literature and managing bibliographies, and an alternative web-based tool for generating smaller bibliographies easily.

I will continue to keep this list updated. If you feel I am missing out on something very useful, do let me know!
