<p>This is my personal/academic website. You can find information about my research in the <a href="/research/">research</a> section. This website also serves as a collection point for resources on elements from my set of interests. This set includes Mathematics, Computing, Materials Science, Books, Music and Writing.</p>

<p>I hope you find some food for thought in my corner of the internet!</p>
