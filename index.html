<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> I am an incoming PhD student in Materials Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science/" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a> in the <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/voorhees/" target="_blank">Voorhees Research Group</a>. I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a> with a bachelors in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and an interdisciplinary masters in Computational Engineering. I am interested in studying the mechanical behaviour of materials using computational tools. This research area sits at the intersection of materials science, mechanical engineering, computational engineering and mathematics.</p>

<p> On top of my <a href="/research/">research</a>, one of my personal goals is life-long learning. I get thrilled when unearthing patterns and connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. I recently found a quote that reflects my viewpoint towards learning:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=47314">
<b>
In an age where it is virtually impossible to stay abreast of technology, it is stimulating to find an analysis concept that enables one to approach an unfamilar field with familiar tools.
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote is from E. O. Brigham's <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=47314" target="_blank"> book </a> on Fast Fourier Transforms. I strongly believe the message can be extrapolated.</p>

<p> Over the past two years, I have been a teaching assistant for three undergraduate courses on scientific computing and materials science. Through these endeavors, I got the opportunity to impart my hard-earned knowledge and make the learning curves of others a little easier. I also gained many insights in the process. Through the experience, I have realised that I have a penchant for teaching, and I would like to keep at it during my graduate studies and beyond.</p>

<p> In my free time, I like tinkering with digital tools that I stumble upon. I also love music, books and <a href="/writing/">writing</a>. I am maintaining a collection of some my favourite tools, utilites, books and authors in <a href="/resources">this page</a>. I hope you find some food for thought in my corner of the internet. If you share some (or all!) of my interests, be sure to reach out! </p>
