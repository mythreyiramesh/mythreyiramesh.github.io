Here, I have listed some tools that I have found to be indispensable at times.

# Writing Mathematics
* [Mathpix Snip Tool](https://mathpix.com){:target="_blank"}: For extracting LaTeX from images and webpages; requires internet for functioning.
* [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html){:target="_blank"}: For quickly getting the LaTeX command for symbols.
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com){:target="_blank"}: For collaborating on LaTeX files.
* [TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com){:target="_blank"}, of course.

# macOS Utilities
* [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com){:target="_blank"}: For easy "window" management on macOS; free altenative to [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com){:target="_blank"}.
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com){:target="_blank"}: Combined with Spotlight, this saves a lot of time.
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh){:target="_blank"}, naturally.

# Miscellaneous
* [Typora](https://www.alfredapp.com){:target="_blank"}: A resourceful markdown editor.
* [Trello](https://trello.com){:target="_blank"}: A tool to stay organised.

I will continue to keep this list updated. If you feel I am missing out on something very useful, do let me know!
